# Lovely Tennis Robot
The Lovely Tennis Robot is an app designed to enhance the experience of playing tennis with a physical robot. The app was created after extensive research and discussions with stakeholders, including potential customers and tennis coaches. The goal was to create an app that not only enhances the experience with the physical robot but also accommodates the needs and preferences of the users.

The app was built using a combination of React and Vite, with TypeScript as the primary coding language, to ensure type safety and improve overall reliability and maintainability of the code. The use of a WebSocket communication system allows for seamless communication between the app and the physical robot, enabling the app to directly control the robot's movements and shots.

# Features
User Research and Design
The Lovely Tennis Robot app was designed with the user in mind. The initial designs were created using Figma, a popular design tool, and then prototyped and pitched to stakeholders. Based on their feedback, the designs were iterated and refined until a final version was agreed upon. The app's interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, with a color scheme that matches the theme and purpose of the robot.

# Direct Smartphone Control
The direct smartphone control feature allows users to control the robot's movements and shots using their smartphone. The app's interface is designed with a joystick that allows users to control the robot's movements and a button to shoot the ball. The WebSocket communication system ensures real-time communication between the smartphone and the robot, resulting in a seamless and enjoyable experience for the user.

# Modes
The app offers users a selection of preset modes tailored to meet their specific needs and training objectives. Users can also create and save their custom modes, allowing them to personalize their training to meet their specific needs. The modes are easily accessible through the app's intuitive user interface, making it simple for users to switch between them.

# Data Analytics
The Lovely Tennis Robot has the potential to collect valuable data during training sessions, such as the number of shots taken, the success rate of shots, and the speed and spin of the ball. This data can be displayed to the user in real-time or after the training session, providing them with useful feedback to improve their skills. The data can also be used for further analysis, allowing coaches or players to identify trends or areas for improvement.

# Future Updates
The Lovely Tennis Robot team plans to introduce hardware and software updates to the system, such as implementing a motion sensor to analyze the robot's movements and further enhancing the user experience. Additionally, there is the potential to incorporate machine learning algorithms that can analyze the data and provide more advanced insights. With these capabilities, the Lovely Tennis Robot can become a powerful tool for players and coaches alike, helping to improve performance and achieve greater success on the court.
